# Next Steps for OpenZeppelin Work Trial

## Current Status ✅

### Exercise 1: Tokenized Bond Monitoring (80% focus) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Deployed tokenized bond contract to Sepolia
- ✅ Configured OpenZeppelin Monitor for 5 risk scenarios
- ✅ Set up Relayer with script triggers (webhooks don't work directly)
- ✅ Created presentation materials in `/deliverables/1/`
- ✅ Documented strategy in `/private-docs/e-1-slide-generation-prompt.md`

### Exercise 2: MMF Security Architecture (20% focus) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Designed multi-oracle architecture with selection criteria
- ✅ Created comprehensive security bundle proposal
- ✅ Generated high-res architecture diagrams (Mermaid → PNG)
- ✅ Built presentation deck with 15 slides
- ✅ All materials in `/deliverables/2/`

## Remaining Tasks 🚀

### 1. Review Architecture Diagrams
- [ ] Verify mmf-architecture-1.png flow is technically accurate
- [ ] Confirm mmf-architecture-2.png sequence is realistic
- [ ] Check mmf-architecture-3.png incident response makes sense

### 2. Presentation Preparation
- [ ] Create actual slide deck from markdown outlines
- [ ] Practice 10-15 minute presentation for each exercise
- [ ] Prepare for technical Q&A using `/private-docs/INTERNAL_TALKING_POINTS.md`

### 3. Time Tracking
- [ ] Document hours spent on Exercise 1
- [ ] Document hours spent on Exercise 2
- [ ] Add time tracking to final submission

### 4. Final Polish
- [ ] Ensure all docs use AcmeBank consistently
- [ ] Verify no references to "challenge" (should be client consultation)
- [ ] Check all technical accuracy (especially Monitor→Relayer via script triggers)

## Key Technical Notes for Handoff 📝

### Critical Integration Details
1. **Monitor-Relayer Communication**: Uses SCRIPT TRIGGERS, not webhooks
   - Monitor sends `message` field
   - Relayer expects `params` field
   - Script trigger bridges this gap

2. **Oracle Architecture**: 
   - Generic "Oracle 1/2/3" approach
   - Teaching criteria for selection
   - Examples given but not prescribed

3. **Diagram Generation**:
   ```bash
   # To regenerate diagrams if needed
   cd /deliverables/2/
   mmdc -i exercise-2-architecture-mermaid.md -o mmf-architecture.png -t dark -b transparent -s 3 -w 1920 -H 1080
   ```
