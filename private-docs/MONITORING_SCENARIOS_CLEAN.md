# Monitoring & Automation Scenarios for Acme Bank Tokenized Bonds

## Core Value Proposition

**The Problem**: Smart contracts can't initiate transactions - they need external triggers
**The Solution**: Monitor + Relayer provide 24/7 automated operations

## Key Monitoring Scenarios (Work Trial Demo Focus)

### 1. Missed Interest Payments Detection

**The Problem**: Interest payment transaction fails or is overdue
**Monitor Detects**: Time-based check (payment overdue) OR transaction failure
**Relayer Response**: Critical alert to operations team via email/SMS

**Monitor Configuration**:
```json
{
  "name": "Missed Payment Monitor",
  "schedule": "0 10 1 * *",  // Check at 10 AM on 1st
  "condition": "paymentDue AND no InterestPaid event in last hour",
  "webhook": "https://relayer.acmebank.com/webhook/missed-payment"
}
```

**Relayer Plugin Action**:
```javascript
// missed-payment-handler.ts
export async function handler(api, params) {
    console.log("🚨 CRITICAL: Interest payment overdue!");
    console.log("📧 Alerting: operations@acmebank.com");
    console.log("📱 SMS to: +1-555-BANK-OPS");
    
    return {
        alert: "critical",
        message: "Interest payment missed - ops team notified",
        channels: ["email", "sms", "slack"]
    };
}
```

**Demo Story**: "It's the 1st, 10 AM. No interest payment detected. Ops gets alert in 5 seconds, not Monday."

### 2. Unauthorized Transfers (Large Transfer Detection)

**The Problem**: Suspicious large transfer already occurred on-chain
**Monitor Detects**: `LargeTransfer` event (>$10M)
**Relayer Response**: Emergency pause to prevent additional transfers

**Monitor Configuration**:
```json
{
  "name": "Large Transfer Monitor",
  "event": "LargeTransfer(address,address,uint256)",
  "condition": "amount > 10000000000000000000000000",  // >10M tokens
  "webhook": "https://relayer.acmebank.com/webhook/large-transfer"
}
```

**Relayer Plugin Action**:
```javascript
// large-transfer-handler.ts
export async function handler(api, params) {
    const { from, to, amount } = params.event;
    console.log(`🚨 Large transfer: ${amount} to ${to}`);
    
    // Pause contract immediately
    const relayer = api.useRelayer("acme-bond-sepolia");
    const PAUSE_SELECTOR = "0x8456cb59";
    
    const result = await relayer.sendTransaction({
        to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        data: PAUSE_SELECTOR,
        speed: "FAST"
    });
    
    return {
        action: "EMERGENCY_PAUSE",
        reason: "Large transfer - preventing more",
        txId: result.id
    };
}
```

**Demo Story**: "$50M transfer detected. Contract paused in 500ms to prevent the NEXT $50M."

### 3. Regulatory Thresholds (Concentration Risk)

**The Problem**: Entity exceeded 20% ownership limit
**Monitor Detects**: `ConcentrationRisk` event
**Relayer Response**: Alert compliance + restrict further purchases

**Monitor Configuration**:
```json
{
  "name": "Concentration Risk Monitor",
  "event": "ConcentrationRisk(address,uint256)",
  "condition": "percentage > 20",
  "webhook": "https://relayer.acmebank.com/webhook/concentration"
}
```

**Relayer Plugin Action**:
```javascript
// concentration-risk-handler.ts
export async function handler(api, params) {
    const { holder, percentage } = params.event;
    console.log(`⚠️ ${holder} owns ${percentage}%`);
    
    console.log("📧 Alerting compliance team...");
    console.log("📊 Generating SEC Form N-Q...");
    
    return {
        action: "COMPLIANCE_ALERT",
        entity: holder,
        ownership: percentage,
        recommendations: [
            "Block further purchases",
            "File SEC notification",
            "Consider forced redemption"
        ]
    };
}
```

**Demo Story**: "Whale hits 21% ownership. Blocked from buying more, compliance alerted."

## Creative Scenarios (Independent Thinking)

### 4. Private Key Compromise Detection

**The Problem**: Unauthorized admin action detected (e.g., upgrade outside change window)
**Monitor Detects**: `Upgraded` event outside of approved maintenance windows
**Relayer Response**: Emergency pause + alert security team

**Monitor Configuration**:
```json
{
  "name": "Unauthorized Admin Action",
  "event": "Upgraded(address)",
  "condition": "NOT IN maintenance_window (Sun 2-4 AM UTC)",
  "webhook": "https://relayer.acmebank.com/webhook/key-compromise"
}
```

**Relayer Plugin Action**:
```javascript
// key-compromise-handler.ts
export async function handler(api, params) {
    const { timestamp, implementation } = params.event;
    
    console.log("🔴 CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT!");
    console.log("Unauthorized upgrade detected outside change window");
    
    // Emergency pause
    const relayer = api.useRelayer("acme-bond-sepolia");
    await relayer.sendTransaction({
        to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        data: EMERGENCY_PAUSE_SELECTOR,
        speed: "FAST"
    });
    
    // Alert security team
    return {
        severity: "CRITICAL",
        action: "EMERGENCY_PAUSE",
        alert: "Possible private key compromise",
        details: {
            event: "Unauthorized upgrade",
            time: timestamp,
            expectedWindow: "Sunday 2-4 AM UTC",
            newImplementation: implementation
        },
        notifications: ["security@acmebank.com", "ciso@acmebank.com"]
    };
}
```

**Demo Story**: "It's Tuesday 3 PM. Someone just upgraded the contract. This wasn't scheduled. Contract paused in 200ms, security team alerted. Potential key compromise contained."

### 5. OFAC Sanctions Screening

**The Problem**: Interest payment attempted to newly sanctioned address
**Monitor Detects**: Interest payment transaction about to execute
**Relayer Response**: Check OFAC list, block payment if sanctioned

**Monitor Configuration**:
```json
{
  "name": "OFAC Compliance Check",
  "function": "distributeInterest()",
  "preprocessing": "check_recipients_against_ofac",
  "webhook": "https://relayer.acmebank.com/webhook/ofac-check"
}
```

**Relayer Plugin Action**:
```javascript
// ofac-screening-handler.ts
export async function handler(api, params) {
    const { recipients } = params;
    
    // Mock OFAC list for demo (in prod, use Chainalysis API)
    const OFAC_LIST = [
        "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
        "0xdeadbeef00000000000000000000000000000000"
    ];
    
    const sanctionedRecipients = recipients.filter(r => 
        OFAC_LIST.includes(r.toLowerCase())
    );
    
    if (sanctionedRecipients.length > 0) {
        console.log("🚫 OFAC VIOLATION PREVENTED!");
        console.log(`Blocked payments to: ${sanctionedRecipients}`);
        
        // Do NOT execute payment
        return {
            success: false,
            action: "PAYMENT_BLOCKED",
            reason: "OFAC sanctioned addresses detected",
            blocked: sanctionedRecipients,
            compliance: {
                report: "SAR filing required within 30 days",
                notification: "compliance@acmebank.com"
            }
        };
    }
    
    // Safe to proceed
    return { success: true, action: "PAYMENT_APPROVED" };
}
```

**Demo Story**: "Monthly interest distribution starting... Wait! Address 0x1234... was just added to OFAC list yesterday. Payment blocked, compliance notified, SAR report initiated. Zero regulatory violation."

## Relayer Automation Examples

### Interest Payment Automation
```javascript

    // Fetch all holders
    const holders = await getHolders();
    
    // Calculate interest with crypto bonus
    const rate = baseRate + cryptoPerformanceBonus;
    
    // Execute batch payment
    await relayer.sendTransaction({
        to: bondContract,
        data: encodeBatchPayment(holders, rate)
    });
}
```

### Emergency Pause
```javascript
async function emergencyPause(reason) {
    // Immediate pause
    await relayer.sendTransaction({
        to: bondContract,
        data: encodePause(reason),
        speed: "FAST"
    });
    
    // Notify all stakeholders
    await notifyStakeholders(reason);
}
```
