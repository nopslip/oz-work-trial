### Slide 3: Critical Challenge - Oracle Selection (1.5 minutes)
**The $1 Trillion Question: Accurate NAV**
- MMF share price depends on underlying asset values
- Single oracle = single point of failure
- Manipulation could cause investor losses
- Regulatory requirement: Reliable pricing
- Our focus: Multi-oracle architecture

### Slide 4: Oracle Strategy (2 minutes)
**Hybrid Multi-Oracle Solution**

  - Largest network, proven reliability
  - Native TradFi data feeds
  - Regulatory acceptance
- **Secondary: API3 (20% weight)**
  - First-party oracles
  - Direct institutional feeds
  - Lower latency
- **Tertiary: Band (10% weight)**
