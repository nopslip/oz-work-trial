  - Direct institutional feeds
  - Lower latency
- **Tertiary: Band (10% weight)**
  - Cost-effective backup
  - Cross-chain ready

### Slide 5: Architecture Overview (1.5 minutes)
**System Components**
[Show architecture diagram]
- Smart Contracts: ERC-4626 vault standard
- Oracle Layer: Multi-source aggregation
- Monitor Layer: Risk detection & automation
- Relayer Layer: Automated operations
- Integration: TradFi + DeFi protocols

### Slide 6: NAV Calculation Flow (1.5 minutes)
**How We Calculate Accurate Share Price**
```
Chainlink → $1.0001 (70%)
API3 → $1.0002 (20%)     → Aggregator → NAV: $1.00014
Band → $1.0003 (10%)
```
