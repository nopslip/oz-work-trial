OpenZeppelin Solution Architect, Financial Institutions – Work Trial Instructions
Thank you for your interest in the Solution Architect, Financial Institutions role at OpenZeppelin.
This work trial has been designed to evaluate your ability to design security solutions and develop
technical proofs-of-concept for tokenization use cases. It simulates the type of work you will be
doing in this role.
Overview of the Work Trial
You will complete two exercises over one week (7 days). We expect a total effort of no more than
20-25 hours. Approximately 80% of your focus should be on the Defender Technical
Implementation (now referred to as Open Source Security Tooling or OSS Tooling). You will present
your deliverables to OpenZeppelin stakeholders during a live session.
We have provided the following resources for your use:
●
OpenZeppelin Service Catalog for Financial Institutions (June 2025) – detailing our security
services and open-source tooling. See the annex at the end of this document for a
summary of key security services offered for financial institutions.
●
Solution Architect Role Description – outlining the core responsibilities and expectations for
this position.
Your task is to demonstrate how you would use OpenZeppelin’s offerings to solve real-world
challenges for financial institutions entering the Web3 space.
Exercise 1: Defender Technical Implementation for a Tokenized Bond (80%)
Scenario: A financial institution has issued a tokenized bond on Ethereum. They need an OSS
Tooling (formerly Defender)-based monitoring solution for operational risks.
Your Task:
●
Define key risks or events to monitor (e.g. missed interest payments, unauthorized
transfers, regulatory thresholds).
●
Design a Monitor and Relayer-based solution to detect these events and automate
appropriate responses.
●
Build a demo showcasing how monitors and relayers can interact with a deployed contract.
●
Deploy a prototype contract to a testnet for use in the demo.
●
Provide sample code/configuration (e.g. Relayer script, Monitor rule logic).
●
Document the detection-response strategy and rationale.
●
Prepare a presentation deck suitable for an institutional client (~10-15 minutes) to walk
through your monitoring solution with an optional but highly recommended live demo
●
Desired Outcome: A technical design and prototype showing how you would apply OSS
Tooling’s Monitors and Relayers (or their open-source equivalents) to deliver operational
security for the tokenised bond.
Exercise 2: Solution Design for a Tokenized Money Market Fund (20%)
Scenario: The same financial institution is now looking to launch a tokenized Money Market Fund
(MMF) on Ethereum. They are currently struggling to select their oracle tooling.
Your Task:
●
Review our service offerings (see annex) and propose a bundled security solution to help
the client with their oracle selection and overall MMF security stack.
●
Identify and explain other security concerns they should be aware of in their tokenized
MMF stack.
●
Design an architecture diagram showing how your proposed components interact (e.g.
smart contracts, monitoring, Relayers).
●
Provide a high-level implementation roadmap.
●
Prepare a client-facing presentation deck (10-15 minutes walkthrough).
●
Desired Outcome: A coherent, well-justified architecture and service bundle that
demonstrates your understanding of financial market security needs and OpenZeppelin’s
capabilities.
Deliverables Summary
For each exercise:
●
Written documentation explaining your solution and rationale.
●
Architecture diagram (Exercise 2) and sample code/configs/deployments (Exercise 1).
●
Presentation slides suitable for institutional stakeholders.
●
Final Presentation
●
You will present both exercises in a live session (approximately 30-45 minutes total). This
is your opportunity to demonstrate communication skills, defend your design choices, and
engage with stakeholders as you would in the role.
How to Approach This Work Trial
●
You are encouraged to research and be creative – we want to see independent thinking
and initiative.
●
Please indicate in your submission how many hours you spent on each exercise.
●
Focus on clarity, logic, and relevance – both in design and presentation.
