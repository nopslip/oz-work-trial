## 2. The Problem
The Challenge: Banks Entering Digital Assets

• **Regulatory Uncertainty** - Existing financial regulations weren't designed for blockchain technology
• **Market Pressure** - Competitors are already tokenizing assets while you evaluate options
• **New Attack Vectors** - Smart contract vulnerabilities and on-chain risks don't exist in traditional finance
• **Operational Complexity** - Need 24/7 monitoring of immutable transactions with instant response capabilities
• **No Established Playbook** - Traditional security vendors don't understand blockchain-specific threats

## 3. Our Solution
OpenZeppelin Meets These Needs

• Built-in compliance monitoring for regulatory requirements
• Production-ready tools used by major financial institutions
• 10+ years securing $100B+ in on-chain value
• Automated 24/7 monitoring with millisecond response times
• Open-source transparency with enterprise support available

## 4. Key Risks We Monitor
5 Critical Operational Scenarios

• **Missed Interest Payments** - Detect overdue payments, alert operations team
• **Large Unauthorized Transfers** - Transfers >$10M trigger emergency pause
• **Regulatory Threshold Breaches** - Entity ownership >20% blocks further purchases
• **Private Key Compromise** - Detect upgrades outside change windows, emergency response
• **OFAC Sanctions Screening** - Block payments to sanctioned addresses automatically

## 5. Live Demo Setup
