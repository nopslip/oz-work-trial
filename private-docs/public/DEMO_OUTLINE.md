# Demo Presentation Outline (10-15 minutes)

## Opening (1 min)
"Today I'll demonstrate how OpenZeppelin's OSS Tooling provides enterprise-grade operational security for tokenized bonds. We'll cover 5 real-world scenarios - 3 from your requirements plus 2 that showcase creative thinking about actual bank concerns."

## Part 1: Required Scenarios (6 min)

### Scenario 1: Missed Interest Payments (2 min)
- **Problem**: Interest payment fails, ops team finds out Monday
- **Demo**: Show payment failure → instant alert
- **Value**: "Never miss an SLA, instant notification"

### Scenario 2: Unauthorized Transfers (2 min)
- **Problem**: $50M suspicious transfer already happened
- **Demo**: Large transfer → contract paused in 500ms
- **Value**: "Can't undo the first transfer, but prevent the next one"

### Scenario 3: Regulatory Thresholds (2 min)
- **Problem**: Entity owns >20% (SEC violation)
- **Demo**: Concentration risk → compliance alert + restrictions
- **Value**: "Automated regulatory compliance"

## Part 2: Creative Scenarios (5 min)
*"Now let me show you two scenarios we identified that banks actually worry about..."*

### Scenario 4: Private Key Compromise (2.5 min)
- **Setup**: "Your biggest fear - an admin key is compromised"
- **Demo**: Upgrade outside maintenance window → emergency pause
- **Innovation**: "Change control windows detect unauthorized actions"
- **Value**: "Contain breaches in seconds, not days"

### Scenario 5: OFAC Sanctions Screening (2.5 min)
- **Setup**: "Someone was added to OFAC list yesterday"
- **Demo**: Interest payment → OFAC check → payment blocked
- **Innovation**: "Pre-transaction compliance screening"
- **Value**: "Zero tolerance for sanctions violations"

## Architecture Deep Dive (2 min)
```
Blockchain → Monitor (detects) → Webhook → Relayer (responds)
```
- Show actual plugin code (30 seconds)
- Explain extensibility (30 seconds)
- Highlight open-source advantage (1 min)

## Closing (1 min)
"What you've seen is production-ready infrastructure that:
- Detects and responds in sub-second time
- Handles both expected and creative risk scenarios
- Costs $0 in licensing
- Gives you complete control

This isn't a proof-of-concept - it's the same architecture securing billions in DeFi, adapted for traditional finance needs."

## Q&A Prep Points
- **Why not just build this into the contract?**
  "Contracts can't self-execute. Monitor/Relayer provides the execution layer."

- **How does this compare to traditional monitoring?**
  "Traditional: Human checks daily. This: Machine checks every block."

- **What about false positives?**
  "Plugin logic is customizable. You define the rules."

- **Integration effort?**
  "Days, not months. Webhook-based integration."

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize
1. **Not just monitoring** - Automated response
2. **Real bank problems** - Key compromise, OFAC
3. **Open source** - No vendor lock-in
4. **Battle-tested** - Same tools as DeFi
5. **Extensible** - Plugin architecture
