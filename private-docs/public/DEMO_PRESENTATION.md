## Demo Flow (10 minutes)

### 1. Operational Risks We Monitor (2 min)
"Financial institutions face five critical operational risks with tokenized assets:"

| Risk | Event | Automated Response |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Missed Interest** | `InterestPaymentDue` | Trigger distribution |
| **Compliance Violation** | `ComplianceViolation` | Pause transfers |
| **Large Transfer** | `LargeTransfer` | Alert compliance team |
| **Emergency Condition** | `EmergencyPause` | Circuit breaker activation |
| **System Recovery** | `Paused` | Auto-unpause after fix |

### 2. Live Detection Demo (3 min)

**Terminal 1 - Monitor Logs:**
```bash
tail -f openzeppelin-monitor/logs/monitor.log | grep -E "DETECTED|WEBHOOK"
```

**Terminal 2 - Trigger Event:**
```bash
# Simulate emergency - pause the contract
cast send 0xB9A538E720f7C05a7A4747A484C231c956920bef "pause()" \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url sepolia
```

**What happens:**
1. Contract emits `Paused` event at block 8957842
2. Monitor detects in <1 second
3. Webhook sent to Relayer plugin
4. Plugin creates `unpause()` transaction
5. System self-heals automatically

### 3. Plugin System Architecture (2 min)

"The plugin system enables custom business logic without modifying core infrastructure:"

```typescript
// pause-handler.ts - Automatic recovery
export async function handler(api: PluginAPI, params: any) {
    const relayer = api.useRelayer("acme-bond-sepolia");
    
    // Automated response: unpause after pause event
    const result = await relayer.sendTransaction({
        to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        data: UNPAUSE_SELECTOR,
        gas_limit: 100000,
        speed: Speed.FAST
    });
    
    return { success: true, transactionId: result.id };
}
```

**Three plugins deployed:**
- `pause-handler`: Auto-recovery from emergency pause
- `interest-handler`: Automated interest distribution  
- `emergency-pause`: Circuit breaker for risk conditions

### 4. Risk Mitigation in Action (2 min)

**Scenario: Interest Payment Due**
```bash
# Monitor detects InterestPaymentDue event
[MONITOR] Event: InterestPaymentDue at block 8957900
[MONITOR] Webhook sent to interest-handler plugin

# Plugin triggers automated distribution
[RELAYER] Plugin: interest-handler executing
[RELAYER] Transaction: distributeInterest() sent
[RELAYER] Confirmed: 0x123... Interest distributed to 1,247 holders
```

**Business Value:**
- No manual intervention required
- Interest never missed (regulatory compliance)
- Complete audit trail
- Sub-second response time

### 5. Production Readiness (1 min)

"This isn't a proof-of-concept - it's production architecture:"

✅ **Enterprise Features:**
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) support
- Multi-signature capabilities  
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Comprehensive logging/monitoring
- Webhook authentication
- Gas price optimization

✅ **Battle-Tested:**
- Same tools securing $10B+ in DeFi
- Used by major protocols (Compound, Aave, etc.)
- 99.99% uptime in production

## Key Messages

### For Financial Institutions
"OpenZeppelin's tools eliminate operational risk in tokenized assets through real-time monitoring and automated response."

### For Compliance Teams
"Every action is logged, auditable, and reversible. The system enforces compliance rules automatically."

### For Engineering Teams  
"Open-source means no vendor lock-in. You own the infrastructure and can customize everything."

### Cost Savings
"$0 licensing fees vs. $100K+ for proprietary solutions. Only pay for cloud infrastructure."

## Technical Proof Points

### 1. Event Detection (Monitor)
```json
{
  "name": "Acme Bond Monitor",
  "events": [
    "InterestPaymentDue(uint256)",
    "ComplianceViolation(address,string)",
    "LargeTransfer(address,address,uint256)",
    "Paused(address)",
    "Unpaused(address)"
  ],
  "triggers": ["webhook_to_relayer"]
}
```

### 2. Automated Response (Relayer)
```bash
# Check loaded plugins
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/plugins \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"

Response:
[
  {"id": "pause-handler", "status": "active"},
  {"id": "interest-handler", "status": "active"},
  {"id": "emergency-pause", "status": "active"}
]
```

### 3. End-to-End Test
```bash
# Manual plugin test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/plugins/interest-handler/call \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"params": {"title": "Interest Due", "body": "Q4 2025"}}'

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "distributeInterest",
  "transactionId": "a0f6dfe8-bc6c-4eb7-a137-28340236f384",
  "message": "Successfully distributed interest payments to all bond holders"
}
```

## Q&A Preparation

**Q: How does this compare to Defender?**
A: "Defender was our hosted solution. These OSS tools give you the same capabilities with full control and no vendor lock-in."

**Q: What about gas costs?**
A: "The Relayer optimizes gas through batching and timing. In production, we've seen 30-40% savings."

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: "The architecture is horizontally scalable. Add more Monitor/Relayer instances as needed."

**Q: Multi-chain support?**
A: "Yes - EVM chains, Solana, and Stellar are supported out of the box."

**Q: Integration with existing systems?**
A: "Webhooks and APIs make integration straightforward. Most teams integrate in days, not months."
