# Exercise 2: Tokenized Money Market Fund Security Architecture
## OpenZeppelin Solution Design for Acme Bank

### Executive Summary

Acme Bank seeks to launch a tokenized Money Market Fund (MMF) on Ethereum, enabling 24/7 liquidity while maintaining regulatory compliance and institutional-grade security. This solution leverages OpenZeppelin's comprehensive security stack to address the unique challenges of on-chain MMF operations, with particular focus on oracle selection and real-time NAV calculation.

### The Business Case

**Traditional MMF Limitations:**
- Trading hours restricted to market hours
- T+1 or T+2 settlement
- High operational overhead
- Limited transparency
- Manual NAV calculations

**Tokenized MMF Advantages:**
- 24/7 global liquidity
- Instant settlement
- Automated operations
- Full transparency
- Real-time NAV updates

### Critical Security Concerns for Tokenized MMF

#### 1. Oracle Manipulation Risk (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**The Problem**: MMF NAV depends on accurate pricing of underlying assets
**The Risk**: Manipulated price feeds could cause incorrect share pricing
**The Solution**: Multi-oracle strategy with deviation checks

#### 2. Regulatory Compliance
**The Problem**: MMFs have strict regulatory requirements (Rule 2a-7)
**The Risk**: Violations could result in regulatory action
**The Solution**: Automated compliance monitoring via OpenZeppelin Monitor

#### 3. Liquidity Management
**The Problem**: Must maintain liquidity for redemptions
**The Risk**: Bank run scenarios or liquidity crunches
**The Solution**: Automated liquidity monitoring and circuit breakers

#### 4. Asset Composition Drift
**The Problem**: MMF must maintain specific asset allocations
**The Risk**: Market movements cause drift from target allocations
**The Solution**: Real-time composition tracking with rebalancing alerts

### Oracle Selection Recommendation

After evaluating multiple oracle solutions, I recommend a **Hybrid Oracle Architecture**:

#### Primary: Chainlink (70% weight)
**Rationale:**
- Largest oracle network with proven track record
- Native support for traditional finance data feeds
- Multiple data sources with aggregation
- Decentralized architecture prevents single points of failure

**Specific Feeds:**
- US Treasury rates (for T-bills in portfolio)
- SOFR/Fed Funds Rate
- Commercial Paper rates
- USD stablecoin prices

#### Secondary: API3 (20% weight)
**Rationale:**
- First-party oracle design perfect for institutional data
- Direct integration with traditional finance data providers
- Lower latency for time-sensitive NAV calculations
- Airnode architecture allows Acme Bank to run own nodes

**Specific Integration:**
- Direct feeds from Acme Bank's custody providers
- Real-time portfolio valuation data
- Internal risk metrics

#### Tertiary: Band Protocol (10% weight)
**Rationale:**
- Cross-chain capabilities for future expansion
- Cost-effective backup option
- Fast finality for quick updates

#### Oracle Aggregation Strategy
```solidity
function calculateNAV() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 chainlinkNAV = getChainlinkNAV();
    uint256 api3NAV = getAPI3NAV();
    uint256 bandNAV = getBandNAV();
    
    // Deviation check - if any oracle deviates >2%, pause
    require(maxDeviation(chainlinkNAV, api3NAV, bandNAV) < 200, "Oracle deviation");
    
    // Weighted average
    return (chainlinkNAV * 70 + api3NAV * 20 + bandNAV * 10) / 100;
}
```
