# Presentation Slides for Exercise 2

**Context**: Presenting TO the same financial institution how OpenZeppelin's comprehensive security stack will protect their tokenized Money Market Fund, with special focus on oracle selection and manipulation prevention.

## 1. Title Slide
Securing Your Tokenized Money Market Fund
Complete Oracle Strategy & Enterprise Security Stack
Powered by OpenZeppelin's Battle-Tested Solutions

Include: OpenZeppelin logo, financial institution placeholder logo

## 2. The Oracle Selection Challenge
Your Current Struggle: Which Oracle Can You Trust?

• **Single Oracle = Single Point of Failure** - Mango Markets lost $100M+ to manipulation
• **Wrong Price = Wrong NAV = SEC Violation** - Regulatory disaster waiting to happen  
• **24/7 Operations** - Traditional price feeds don't work for always-on MMFs
• **Complex Assets** - Need Treasury yields, money market rates, forex, all in real-time
• **No Proven Playbook** - Every vendor claims to be "institutional grade"

## 3. Real-World Oracle Disasters
What Happens Without Proper Oracle Security

• **Mango Markets**: $100M+ lost to price manipulation
• **Venus Protocol**: $150M bad debt from oracle failure
• **Compound Wargame**: $700K would have been lost (OpenZeppelin prevented it)
• **Inverse Finance**: $15.6M stolen via oracle manipulation
• **Cream Finance**: $130M hack partially due to price feed issues

**The Pattern**: Single oracle dependency = catastrophic vulnerability

## 4. Our Solution: Multi-Oracle Defense
Learned from Compound Wargame Success

**Three-Layer Protection**:
1. **Multiple Independent Oracles** - Chainlink + API3 + Chronicle
2. **Cross-Validation Logic** - 15% deviation threshold (proven in Compound simulation)
3. **Anchor Price Comparison** - Secondary validation against DEX prices

**Key Innovation**: Same approach that detected the 28% WETH manipulation in minutes

## 5. How We Prevented $700K Loss (Case Study)
Compound Wargame Simulation - July 2024

• **The Attack**: Rogue oracle reports WETH 28% above market
• **OpenZeppelin Detection**: Monitor catches >15% deviation from anchor
• **Response Time**: Alert triggered in <30 seconds
• **Action Taken**: Market paused before exploitation
• **Result**: $0 lost vs potential $700K drain

**Your MMF Gets This Same Protection**

## 6. Complete MMF Security Architecture

## 9. MMF-Specific Security Concerns
Risks We've Identified & Addressed

| Risk | Impact | Our Mitigation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| NAV Manipulation | SEC violation, investor losses | Multi-oracle + anchor validation |
| Bank Run | Liquidity crisis | Smart gates + queue management |
| Negative Rates | Breaking assumptions | Floor at 0%, special handling |
| Stablecoin Depeg | NAV distortion | Real-time monitoring, auto-rebalance |
| Flash Loan Attack | Instant drain | TWAP + multi-block validation |

## 10. Implementation Roadmap
Phased Approach to Production

**Phase 1: Oracle Integration**
• Deploy 3-oracle setup
• Implement consensus logic
• Add deviation detection

**Phase 2: Smart Contract Development**
• MMF token with NAV calculation
• Portfolio management
• Compliance controls

**Phase 3: Security Audit & Testing**
• Contract audit
• Manipulation simulations
• Stress testing

**Phase 4: Production Launch**
• Mainnet deployment
• Monitor activation
• 24/7 operations begin

## 11. Live Detection Demo
What Your Team Will See

**Monitor Dashboard**:
```
[ALERT] Oracle Deviation Detected
- Chainlink USDT: $1.00
- API3 USDT: $1.01  
- Chronicle USDT: $1.28 ⚠️
- Deviation: 28% (Threshold: 15%)
- Action: PAUSING NAV UPDATES
- Status: Webhook sent to Relayer
```

**Response Time**: <2 seconds from detection to pause

## 12. Cost-Benefit Analysis
Strong ROI from Day One

**Investment**:
• Initial Setup & Audits
• Annual Operations & Support
• Oracle Feed Subscriptions

**Returns**:
• Avoid single oracle manipulation (reference: $700K Compound simulation)
• Operational efficiency gains
• 24/7 operations capability
• Instant settlement (T+0 vs T+1)
• Risk mitigation value

**Key Point**: One prevented incident pays for entire implementation
