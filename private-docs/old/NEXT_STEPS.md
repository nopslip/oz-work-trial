# Next Steps to Complete the Demo

## Priority 1: Fix Monitor Logging (CRITICAL)

### The Problem
Monitor silently detects events and sends webhooks with ZERO logging. This makes the demo impossible because we can't show what's happening.

### Solutions to Try
1. **Check log level configuration**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --log-level debug
   # or
   export RUST_LOG=debug
   cargo run
   ```

2. **Add custom logging to monitor config**
   - Look for notification/trigger success callbacks
   - May need to modify trigger config to add logging

3. **Use metrics endpoint**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --metrics --metrics-address 127.0.0.1:8081
   ```
   Then check metrics for event counts

### Expected Logs We NEED to See
```
[INFO] Event detected: Paused(address) at block 8956915
[INFO] Matched monitor: proper-monitor
[INFO] Triggering webhook: emergency_pause_webhook
[INFO] Webhook sent successfully to http://localhost:8080/...
```

## Priority 2: Fix Relayer Transaction Execution

### Option A: Use the acme-bond-relayer.json Config
This config has webhook endpoints mapped to transactions:
- `/trigger-interest` → `distributeInterest()`
- `/emergency-pause` → `emergencyPause(string)`

**Problem**: Not sure how to make Relayer load this config properly

### Option B: Configure Standard Relayer API
Use the `/api/v1/transactions` endpoint with proper payload:
```json
{
  "relayer_id": "acme-bond-sepolia",
  "to": "0xB9A538E720f7C05a7A4747A484C231c956920bEf",
  "data": "0x4e71d92d",  // distributeInterest() function selector
  "gas_limit": "500000"
}
```

### Option C: Create Simple Webhook Handler
Write a minimal Node.js service that:
1. Receives webhooks from Monitor
2. Calls Relayer API to execute transactions
3. Logs everything visibly

## Priority 3: Complete End-to-End Flow

### What Success Looks Like
```
1. Run: ./run-demo.sh
2. See in Monitor logs:
   [INFO] Event detected: InterestPaymentDue
   [INFO] Sending webhook to trigger interest distribution
   
3. See in Relayer logs:
   [INFO] Webhook received: trigger-interest
   [INFO] Executing transaction: distributeInterest()
   [INFO] Transaction submitted: 0x123...
   
4. Verify on Etherscan:
   - Interest distribution transaction executed
   - Triggered automatically by Monitor → Relayer
```

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Force Monitor to Log Events (Hacky but Works)
Add a script trigger that just logs:
```json
{
  "name": "log_everything",
  "trigger_type": "script",
  "config": {
    "script_path": "./log-event.sh",
    "language": "bash"
  }
}
```

Where `log-event.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "[DETECTED] Event: $EVENT_NAME at block $BLOCK_NUMBER"
```

### 2. Test Transaction Execution Directly
Manually call Relayer API to verify it can execute transactions:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer A21E413E-DF82-4FFB-8525-51971CB00F70" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "relayer_id": "acme-bond-sepolia",
    "to": "0xB9A538E720f7C05a7A4747A484C231c956920bEf",
    "data": "0x3f4ba83a",  // unpause() selector
    "gas_limit": "100000"
  }'
```

## Documentation We Need from OpenZeppelin

1. **CRITICAL**: Clear statement that `contract_spec` is REQUIRED for event matching
2. How to enable verbose logging in Monitor
3. Complete webhook payload format for Relayer
4. How to map webhook endpoints to contract functions
5. Example of full working Monitor → Relayer integration

## Minimum Viable Demo

If we can't get full automation working, we need at least:

1. **Monitor shows detection** (even if we have to use debug logging)
2. **Webhook is sent** (proven by Relayer receiving it)
3. **Manual trigger** of what would happen (call the contract function ourselves)

Then we can say: "In production, this webhook would trigger automatic execution"

## Time Estimate

- Fix logging: 30 minutes (if flag exists)
- Fix transaction execution: 2-4 hours (depends on Relayer config complexity)
- Full working demo: 4-6 hours
- Minimum viable demo: 1-2 hours

## The Real Issue

OpenZeppelin's documentation is missing critical details:
- No mention that `contract_spec` is required
- No examples of Monitor logging configuration
- No complete Monitor → Relayer example
- No troubleshooting guide for "Monitor not detecting events"

This cost us 4+ hours that should have been 30 minutes.
