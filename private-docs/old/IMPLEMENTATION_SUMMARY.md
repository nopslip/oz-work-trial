# OpenZeppelin OSS Stack Implementation Summary

## âœ… What We've Actually Built and Deployed

### 1. **Smart Contract Deployed to Sepolia**
- **Contract**: TokenizedBond at `0xE8bc7ff409dD6DceA77b3A948AF2c6a18E97327f`
- **Verified on Etherscan**: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe8bc7ff409dd6dcea77b3a948af2c6a18e97327f
- **Features**:
  - ERC20 tokenized bond with interest payments
  - KYC/compliance controls
  - Comprehensive monitoring events
  - Emergency pause capabilities
  - Uses OpenZeppelin libraries (AccessControl, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard)

### 2. **OpenZeppelin MCP Integration**
- âœ… Connected MCP server to Claude Code
- âœ… Available for generating contracts via AI
- âœ… Demonstrates next-gen development approach

### 3. **Monitoring Service (OpenZeppelin Pattern)**
- âœ… Created monitoring service following OpenZeppelin Monitor patterns
- âœ… Real-time event monitoring
- âœ… WebSocket for dashboard connections
- âœ… Webhook endpoints for Relayer integration
- âœ… Monitoring:
  - Large transfers
  - Interest payment schedules
  - Compliance violations
  - Emergency actions
  - KYC status changes

### 4. **OpenZeppelin Tools Cloned & Configured**
- âœ… Cloned official OpenZeppelin Monitor repository
- âœ… Cloned official OpenZeppelin Relayer repository
- âœ… Created configuration files for both
