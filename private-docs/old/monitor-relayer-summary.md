## Implementation Strategy for Tokenized Bond
1. **Monitor Setup**:
   - Monitor Transfer events for large transactions
   - Monitor interest payment schedules
   - Monitor compliance violations
   - Monitor emergency actions

2. **Relayer Setup**:
   - Automate interest payments
   - Execute compliance responses
   - Handle emergency pauses

3. **Alternative Approach** (if time constraints):
   - Use ethers.js for event monitoring
   - Use defender-sdk npm package for simplified integration
   - Build custom Node.js scripts for automation
