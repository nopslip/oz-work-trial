# OpenZeppelin Defender OSS Stack Notes

## Overview
OpenZeppelin has transitioned from the proprietary Defender platform to open-source alternatives:

### Monitor (Replaces Defender Monitors)
- Real-time onchain activity monitoring
- Detect critical events and anomalies
- Trigger alerts and automated responses
- Can be self-hosted in your infrastructure
- GitHub: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/defender-sdk

### Relayer (Replaces Defender Relayers)
- Automate onchain transactions
- Schedule jobs and batch calls
- Support for gasless meta-transactions
- Self-hostable solution
- GitHub: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/defender-sdk

## SDK Installation
```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/defender-sdk
```

## Key Documentation Links
- SDK Docs: https://api-docs.defender.openzeppelin.com/
- GitHub: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/defender-sdk
- Open Source Stack: https://www.openzeppelin.com/open-source-stack#operate

## Implementation Strategy for Work Trial
1. Use the defender-sdk for programmatic monitoring
2. Implement custom monitors for bond-specific events
3. Create relayers for automated responses
4. Build a dashboard to visualize monitoring data

## Alternative Approach (if SDK issues)
- Use ethers.js/web3.js for direct event monitoring
- Implement custom webhook/alerting system
- Use node-cron for scheduled tasks
- Deploy monitoring scripts to cloud infrastructure
