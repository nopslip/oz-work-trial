# OpenZeppelin Monitor + Relayer Demo Status

## Date: August 10, 2025

## What We Accomplished ✅

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment
- **Contract**: AcmeBankCryptoBond deployed to Sepolia at `0xB9A538E720f7C05a7A4747A484C231c956920bEf`
- **Events**: Successfully emitting Paused, Unpaused, EmergencyPause events
- **Verified**: Events visible on Etherscan

### 2. Monitor Configuration & Event Detection
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Monitor DOES detect events, but requires `contract_spec` with exact event structure
- **Key Discovery**: Without `contract_spec`, Monitor processes blocks but can't decode events
- **Working Config**: `/config/monitors/proper-monitor.json` with full event definitions
- **Network**: Connected to Google Cloud Blockchain Node Engine RPC
- **Confirmation**: Reduced from 12 blocks to 1 for faster detection

### 3. Monitor → Relayer Webhook Integration
- **SUCCESS**: Native webhooks ARE supported (no middleware needed!)
- **Authentication**: Working with API key `A21E413E-DF82-4FFB-8525-51971CB00F70`
- **Evidence**: Relayer logs show `200 OK` responses to webhook requests
- **Issue**: Webhooks hitting info endpoint (`/api/v1/relayers`), not transaction endpoints

### 4. Infrastructure Setup
- **Monitor**: Running and processing blocks every minute
- **Relayer**: Running with proper keystore and authentication
- **Redis**: Container running for Relayer state management
- **Environment**: Using `.env` files for configuration (no hardcoded keys)

## What's Still Broken ❌

### 1. Monitor Logging
- **CRITICAL**: Monitor doesn't log when it detects events or sends webhooks
- **Problem**: Silent success = no visibility into what's happening
- **Impact**: Can't demo if we can't show event detection in logs

### 2. Relayer Transaction Execution
- **Issue**: Relayer receives webhooks but doesn't execute transactions
- **Root Cause**: Using basic `config.json` instead of `acme-bond-relayer.json`
- **Missing**: Webhook handlers that map to actual contract functions

### 3. Webhook Payload
- **Current**: Webhooks just notify, don't include transaction data
- **Needed**: Proper transaction payload with function calls
- **Example**: Should send `distributeInterest()` call data

## Architecture That's Working

```
Contract Event (✅) → Monitor Detects (✅) → Webhook Sent (✅) → Relayer Receives (✅) → Execute TX (❌)
```

## Why This Matters for the Demo

### What We CAN Show:
- Real-time event detection from blockchain
- Native webhook integration between services
- Authentication and security working
- Open source stack with zero licensing

### What We CAN'T Show (Yet):
- Automated transaction execution
- Full closed-loop automation
- Visible logs of the detection → action flow
- Actual risk mitigation responses

## Time Spent vs. Progress

- **4+ hours** debugging why Monitor wouldn't detect events
- **Root cause**: Missing `contract_spec` in monitor config
- **This should have taken**: 30 minutes with proper documentation
- **Documentation gap**: Nowhere does it clearly state `contract_spec` is REQUIRED for event matching
