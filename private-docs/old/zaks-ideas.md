exercise 1: 

If we only demo the ideas they gave us, it shows we lack creattivity. We should also demo our own ideas.

Private Key compromise - What does a private key compromise look like?  If someone on the contract is executed with a compromised private key, what happens?  We should demo this. how do we know? 

Monitor: perhaps and upgrade outside of change control window?  

Replayer: Pause! 


next scenario.. 

attempted interest payment to sanctionied addy.. someone purchased a bond and has been recieveing interest payments for sometime with out issue. however.. the address was just added to the OFAC sanctions list.. instead of sending the interest payment, we NOT send it and notify security/ops of the attempt to send to sanctioned addy. for the sake of the demo we can likely set the interest payment relayer plugin to simple check a local list of 'ofac addys' or use a free public api. 


these two scenarios would show creative thining beyond the provided examples!
