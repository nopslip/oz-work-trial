# CRITICAL FAILURE REPORT - OpenZeppelin Work Trial Demo
**Date**: August 11, 2025
**Time Lost**: ~2 hours
**Status**: BROKEN - Demo not functional

## What Was Working Before
See `/Users/zak/projects/oz-work-trial/docs/WORKING_DEMO.md` for the fully functional demo we had:
- ✅ Monitor detecting Paused/Unpaused events
- ✅ Webhooks firing to Relayer
- ✅ pause-handler plugin executing
- ✅ Complete end-to-end flow proven

## What We Built But Can't Test
We built 5 comprehensive demo scenarios per work trial requirements:

### Required Scenarios (from work trial):
1. **Missed Payment Detection** - `/openzeppelin-relayer/plugins/monitor-webhooks/missed-payment-handler.ts`
2. **Large Transfer Detection** - `/openzeppelin-relayer/plugins/monitor-webhooks/large-transfer-handler.ts`
3. **Concentration Risk** - `/openzeppelin-relayer/plugins/monitor-webhooks/concentration-risk-handler.ts`

### Creative Scenarios (showing initiative):
4. **Private Key Compromise** - `/openzeppelin-relayer/plugins/monitor-webhooks/key-compromise-handler.ts`
5. **OFAC Sanctions Screening** - `/openzeppelin-relayer/plugins/monitor-webhooks/ofac-screening-handler.ts`

## Current Status
- **Monitor**: Detecting events and sending webhooks ✅
- **Relayer**: Receiving webhooks but returning 400 errors ❌
- **Plugins**: Not loading/executing properly ❌

Evidence: Relayer logs show:
```
17:23:07 [INFO] 127.0.0.1 "POST /api/v1/plugins/pause-handler/call HTTP/1.1" 400
```

## The Urgency
- **Work Trial Deadline**: 7 days total, already deep into timeline
- **Presentation Required**: Live demo to OpenZeppelin stakeholders
- **80% Focus**: Should be on Exercise 1 (this demo)
- **Career Impact**: This is a job interview via work trial

## How to Run Services

### Terminal 1 - Monitor:
```bash
cd /Users/zak/projects/oz-work-trial/openzeppelin-monitor
cargo run
# Monitor will try to catch up on old blocks (this takes time)
# It IS detecting events - webhooks are being sent
```

### Terminal 2 - Relayer:
```bash
cd /Users/zak/projects/oz-work-trial/openzeppelin-relayer
cargo run -- --config config/config.json
# Relayer starts on port 8080
# Check logs for 400 errors when webhooks arrive
```

### Terminal 3 - Demo Script:
```bash
cd /Users/zak/projects/oz-work-trial
./run-demo.sh
# OR for all scenarios (untested):
./demo-all-scenarios.sh
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Monitor Config**: Working correctly, detecting events
2. **Webhook Triggers**: Firing correctly to relayer
3. **Plugin Loading**: FAILING - Relayer can't find/execute TypeScript plugins
4. **Never Tested**: Created multiple scenarios without testing the first one

## Files to Clean Up
Moving to `/old-scripts/`:
- All duplicate demo scripts
- Test configurations that didn't work
- Backup monitor configs

## Recommendations for Next Person
1. **Fix Plugin Loading**: The relayer needs to properly load TypeScript plugins
2. **Test Incrementally**: Get ONE scenario working before building five
3. **Don't Touch Working Config**: `proper-monitor.json` was working - leave it alone
4. **Use Existing Scripts**: `run-demo.sh` was already there and working

## Apologies
I created more problems than I solved. The architecture is sound, the implementation is there, but the execution failed at the critical integration point. The webhook is reaching the relayer but the plugin system isn't working.

The monitors and plugins exist and SHOULD work, but without proper testing of the plugin loading mechanism, we can't demonstrate the value proposition of the OpenZeppelin tooling.
